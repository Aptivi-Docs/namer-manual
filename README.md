# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to Namer! It's a library that uses our own names database, NamesList, to generate random names and surnames. This library promises to be customizable using various options from generating 10 names by default to generating more than 50 names with preferences.

To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.

## Installation

This library is very easy to install. It's available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Namer/). Just follow these steps:

1. Open your project file (`.csproj` or `.fsproj`)
2. Place the `PackageReference` line on a property group like so:
   * `<PackageReference Include="Namer" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * ...where `Version` is the current version of the library
3. Run a package restore using `dotnet restore`

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to use Namer's functions.
